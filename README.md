Project Description

Story Wizard AI Generator is a web application that creates magical, child-friendly stories from different types of prompts.
The backend is built with Flask (Python) and integrates Google’s Gemini API to generate stories based on:

📝 Text prompts

🎤 Audio input (speech-to-text + story generation)

🖼️ Images (AI turns them into creative narratives)

The frontend is developed with Next.js and Tailwind CSS, providing a simple and engaging interface for users to interact with the story generator.

This project demonstrates the use of Flask REST APIs, Gemini generative models, and a modern React/Next.js frontend to deliver an AI-powered storytelling experience.
